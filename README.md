# 📡 pcap-miner-system

`pcap-miner-system` is a lightweight **PCAP analysis platform** with a **web-based dashboard**.  
It automatically captures network traffic from Docker containers, processes it using [demisto/pcap-miner](https://github.com/demisto/pcap-miner), and provides an intuitive interface for browsing analysis results in real-time.  

---

## 🎯 Features

- **Automatic Traffic Capture** – Monitors and captures network traffic from all running Docker containers  
- **PCAP-Miner Integration** – Leverages `demisto/pcap-miner` for professional-grade packet analysis  
- **Web Dashboard** – Modern and minimal UI for exploring PCAP analyses directly in the browser  
- **Auto-Processing** – New PCAP files are automatically analyzed  
- **Real-time Updates** – Dashboard refreshes every 10 seconds to always show the latest results
